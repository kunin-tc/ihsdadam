# Installation Instructions:
# ========================
#
# OPTION 1 - Install all at once:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# OPTION 2 - Install individually:
#   pip install openpyxl
#   pip install PyPDF2
#   pip install pyinstaller  (only if building .exe)
#
# Verification:
#   python -c "import openpyxl; print('openpyxl installed:', openpyxl.__version__)"
#   python -c "import PyPDF2; print('PyPDF2 installed:', PyPDF2.__version__)"
#
# Notes:
# - openpyxl is REQUIRED for Data Compiler tab to work
# - PyPDF2 is REQUIRED for Appendix Generator tab to work
# - Visual View uses Tkinter Canvas (no external libraries needed)
# - PyInstaller is only needed if you want to create standalone .exe
